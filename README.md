# Employee Management System

Welcome to my first full stack application I created on a whim. At first I got started because I wanted to add something to my resume for a position I was applying for, but eventually it got really fun.

Being able to create an actual application (not just frontend) was surprisingly more exciting than I thought.

I abused ChatGPT for help, but that actually taught me a lot about the development process that many applications go through.

## Here's the tech stack.

### 🐳 Backend

- Java
- JSP
- Spring Boot

### 🥗 Database

- PostgreSQL

### 🧀 Frontend

- React
- Vite
- CSS

## Accessing the Application

TBD - I'm still working on it.
